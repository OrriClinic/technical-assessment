# Functional requiremets

Create a single page React App (created using `create-react-app` or other boiler plate package - you can choose any you like with Typescript or Javascript) that allows a user to:

- add any number of 'repeating appointment schedules' during a week (e.g. 10-11 on a Monday, 09:00-09:30 each working day etc)
- add a start and end time and a subject for each 'repeating appointment schedule' (see data format below)
- have their schedule checked against existing schedules and any overlaps detected before create (this is only required for schedules in the same timezone)
- define the TimeZone in which the schedule is to be based - e.g. a 09-10 on a Monday repeating appointment schedule in the 'Europe/London' timezone would appear at '2022-10-10 09:00:00+01:00' and at '2022-10-31 09:00:00+00:00' in the 'Europe/London' timezone when BST is active (TimeZone can be specified for all schedules or specific to each schedule)
- allow the user to select (1) a specific week and (2) a display timezone and have all the appointments generated by the 'repeating appointment schedules' shown with actual start and end times for that week. This can be in a simple list or using a visual component view like `react-big-calendar`.

# Schedule data format

Each of the schedules shgould be represented by the following data structure

```javascript
{
  day: 1, // integer
  startHour: 10, // integer 0-23
  startMin: 0, // integer 0-59
  endHour: 10, // integer 0-23
  endMin: 30, // integer 0-59
  subject: 'A string subject', // string,
  timeZone: 'Europe/London', // optional if individual schedule is tied to a timezone
}

// day can be:
// 1 - 5 (ISO Day Number : 1 = Monday, 2 = Tuesday etc)
// 10 (each working day)
// 20 (every day)
```

# Non functional requirements

The single page app should:

- have a neat, clear and well formatted layout using CSS. Bonus points for it being responsive for display on a mobile device
- persist state in the page only (no need for save to disk or back end)

The single page app does not need to deal with all potential error cases, however any that are identified but not implemented should be commented as such in the code.

# Submission
