# Functional requiremets

Create a single page React App (created using `create-react-app` or other boiler plate package) that allows a user to:

- create more than one 'repeating appointment schedule' during a week (e.g. 10-11 on a Monday, 09:00-09:30 each working day etc)
- add a start and end time and a subject for each 'repeating appointment schedule'
- be able to add many 'repeating appointment schedules'
- have their schedule checked against existing schedules and any overlaps detected
- define the TimeZone in which the schedule is to be based - e.g. a 09-10 on a Monday repeating appointment schedule in the 'Europe/London' timezone would appear at '2022-10-10 09:00:00+01:00' and at '2022-10-31 09:00:00+00:00' in the 'Europe/London' timezone
- select a specific Monday date and a display timezone and have all the appointments generated by the 'repeating appointment schedules' shown with actual start and end times for that week

# Non functional requirements

The single page app should:

- have a neat, clear and well formatted layout using CSS. Bonus points for it being responsive for display on a mobile device
- persist state in the page only (no need for save to disk or back end)

The single page app does not need to deal with all potential error cases, however any that are identified but not implemented should be commented as such in the code.

# Submission

Commit the code to github and share access with @iainad
